# Genetic music
One of our recent projects that makes melodies based on genetic algorithm idea.

Can't be called true genetic algorithm because of nonautomatical fitness function. May be changed in future versions.

Can be used as precursor for some bigger music projects as well as inspiration for musicians.

We are open for critique, ideas and partnerships.

Usage is shown in the Implementation.ipynb file. You may need to install packages in order to have it working.
Jupyter notebooks have pip so just make a new code line, type 'pip install {name_of_missing_package}' and try again.
