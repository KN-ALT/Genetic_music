# Genetic_music
One of our recent projects that makes melodies based on genetic algorithm idea.

Can't be called true genetic algorithm because of nonautomatical fitness function. May be changed in future versions.

Can be used as precursor for some bigger music projects as well as inspiration for musicians.

We are open for critique, ideas and partnerships.
